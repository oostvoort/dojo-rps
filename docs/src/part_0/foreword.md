# Foreword

According to its creators, "Dojo is a provable game engine with an integrated toolchain,
designed for creating onchain games and autonomous worlds using Cairo 1.0." Its goal is to speed
up game development to hours instead of weeks. With Dojo being a relatively new piece of technology,
the author has compiled this tutorial that will speed up learning Dojo. In this tutorial, the author
will challenge the reader to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that will simultaneously tour
the reader through Dojo concepts in a simplified manner.
