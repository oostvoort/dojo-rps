# Understanding the Directory

After cloning the git repository, the reader should be faced with the following directory:
1. contracts - this is where all the smart contracts are stored.
2. docs - this is where all the documentation to this tutorial is stored
3. web - this is where the ReactJS front end code is written. This takes inspiration from MUD but there are also tweaks here and there to conform to Dojo.

Feel free to make adjustments as necessary. This tutorial does not aim to create a strict way to develop
using Dojo, but to enhance the Dojo experience and streamline it further to extend its reach in the
Web3 World.
