At its core, Dojo aims to build Autonomous Worlds (AWs) and onchain games. It uses Entity Component
Systems to model its entire architecture. All the entities, components, and systems are written in
Cairo, a programming language inspired by Rust. In theory, Dojo's smart contracts can be used in a 
myriad of platforms. To demonstrate this, the author wishes to use the power of the web to display
the capabilities of Dojo. Specifically this tutorial is targeted towards developers with React knowledge.
